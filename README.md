# eXpServer Tester Utility

A robust testing framework for server implementation, featuring an interactive UX and a scalable bakcend using WebSockets and Dockerized test execution. Designed to help students validate their server implementation through automated blackbox testing

## Overview

The project provides:
- Easy to use frontend interface for the student to submit and test their code
- A high-concurrency WebSocket-based backend architecture that executes student submitted binaries in isolated Docker containers and streams their test feedback

**Note** 
This system is built exclusively to act as a testing utility for [eXpServer](https://expserver.github.io/)

## Key Features
- Frontend
    - Real-time test progress visualization
