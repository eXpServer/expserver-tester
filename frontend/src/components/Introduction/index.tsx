# Introduction

Welcome to the **eXpServer-Testbench** platform — a comprehensive solution designed to simplify and automate the process of testing server-side applications in a controlled and insightful environment.

This platform is especially useful for developers, students, and educators who are working on low-level network or systems programming and want a streamlined way to test compiled binaries with predefined test cases, real-time logs, and system resource monitoring.

With an intuitive interface and modular structure, eXpServer-Testbench provides a complete testbench environment where you can:

- Upload and manage your compiled binary files.
- Run tests that simulate realistic client-server interactions.
- Monitor system performance metrics like CPU and memory utilization.
- View real-time server logs and test case status.
- Understand detailed reasons for test failures via contextual modals.

The platform is divided into several sections, each with a clear and focused purpose. You’ll find side navigation to easily switch between these sections:

- **Overview** – Get a summary of the test layout and main functionalities.
- **Console** – See live server logs during the test execution.
- **Execution** – Upload, run, and monitor your tests and system usage.
- **Testcase** – View individual test cases, their status, and failure insights.
- **Failed Modal** – Explore detailed reasons for failures to debug your binary effectively.

Whether you're testing a basic TCP echo server or evaluating a multi-threaded server under load, this platform will guide you through the process, ensuring clarity, traceability, and efficiency at every step.

Let’s get started!


## Overview

1. On the left, there is a sidebar which can be used to toggle between phases and stages.  
2. In the center, there is a detailed test description which explains what will be tested and the expected behavior.  
3. On the right, there is an execution tab where you can upload a compiled binary file, run it, and see the real-time test status and results.

## Console

If you check the center part, at the top you can toggle between the **Test Description** and the **Console** tabs.  
The Console displays real-time server logs while the test is running.

## Execution

On the left, we have the execution section:

1. You can add and delete the binary file. After adding the binary file, press **"Run"** to run the test.  
2. The **Resource Monitor** section shows real-time CPU and memory utilization. It also displays the time taken by the test to run in the backend.  
3. Another section shows the real-time test status: **Pending**, **Running**, **Passed**, or **Failed**. At the bottom, you’ll find the overall test results.

## Testcase

1. Displays the test case number and its status.  
2. If a test fails, an **"info"** icon appears next to the test case number. Clicking this icon opens a modal that describes possible reasons why the test might have failed.
