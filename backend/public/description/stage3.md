# Stage 3: UDP Multithreading

## Overview
One of the main aspects of a server, is it's ability to handle multiple clients at once. At the end of stage 1, we had created a simple TCP server that is able to handle a single TCP connection at once. This stage aims at creating a server that supports multiple clients at once and has the ability to communicate to them simultaneously. We explore a different protocol, an alternative to TCP, namely [UDP](https://expserver.github.io/guides/resources/udp-socket-programming.html) in this stage, to make you comfortable with working with either of the protocols, as per the use-case, in your future endevours. The multiple simultaneous connections are handled at once, using [multithreading](https://expserver.github.io/guides/resources/process-and-threads.html).

## Constraints to be followed
- The server is expected to run on port `8080`
- Server should be able to accept an incoming TCP connection and properly handle any errors that might occur.
- Server should receive string and reverse it, while leaving any trailing `\n` intact.
    - eg: `abcd\n` should be reversed as `dcba\n`

## Tests
### Test 1: Single client - input output
This test ensures that the server runs as expected when a singular client is connected

```js
testInput: "client sends a randomly generated string to the server"
expectedBehavior: "client receives reversed version of the input"
```

### Test 2: Multiple clients to same port - input output
This test ensures that the server is able to handle multiple connections at once and verifies the response received by each of the client

```js
testInput: "Connect multiple clients to server and sends unique string simultaneously"
expectedBehavior: "Each of the clients should receive reversed versions of their input"
```

### Test 3: Error handling
In the current implementation of the server, there should be no inturruption in service when a singular client disconnects. This test ensures that previously connected clients, as well as new clients are able to connect, send to and receive from the server even after a client has diconnected

```js
testInput: "client forcefully disconnects"
expectedBehavior: "Previous and new clients are able to send and receive output as expected"
```
